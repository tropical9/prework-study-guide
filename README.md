# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is built while completing my prework for the coding bootcamp. My motivation in building this webpage is to be ready for the upcoming bootcamp and so that I have a place to keep what I have learn and continue to learn during bootcamp. In this prework, I have learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
